# üéµ Music Data Analysis & Mental Health Modeling üéµ 
<sub><i>A data science project exploring the relationship between music and mental health</i></sub>

---

## üìå Project Background

The recommendation algorithm of YouTube is great at suggesting music **within the user‚Äôs comfort zone**, but not so much **beyond it**. This can result in missed opportunities to discover new genres or emotionally helpful music.

> _What if music recommendations could be tailored not only by genre but also by psychological needs?_

Inspired by this question, I analyzed music-related survey data focusing on **the relationship between music habits and mental health**, especially **insomnia**.

## üîç Key Research Questions

I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer questions such as:

- üìä **User Behavior**
  - What are the top-ranked music streaming services?
  - BPM patterns across preferred genres
  - Do musicians also compose music? Vice versa?
  - How much time do composers or instrumentalists spend listening to music?
  - Do people who listen to music while working spend more time on average?

- üåê **Listening Habits**
  - Proportion of users who listen to foreign-language music
  - How does the number of genres relate to exploratory tendencies?

- üß† **Mental Health Correlations**
  - What is the correlation between **anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD**?
  - Does music listening time affect mental health metrics?
  - Do music effects (e.g., healing, emotional impact) show a pattern with mental health?
  - Do music creators (composers, instrumentalists) show higher or lower mental distress?

- üéß **Genre-Based Insights**
  - How favorite genres relate to anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD
  - Does genre diversity help with mental health?

## üß™ Modeling: Predicting Insomnia

After EDA, **5 key features** with potential relationships to insomnia were selected:

| Feature | Type |
|--------|------|
| üéº Composing music | Binary |
| üéπ Playing an instrument | Binary |
| üé∂ Number of music genres listened to | Numerical |
| üòî Depression level | Continuous |
| üòµ OCD level | Continuous |

I framed it as a **binary classification** problem:  
**‚ÄúDoes the user suffer from insomnia?‚Äù**  

The final model used was:

> ‚úÖ **Logistic Regression**

I evaluated performance using standard classification metrics (accuracy, recall, etc.) and validated the features' relevance in predicting insomnia symptoms.

## üìà Insights & Reflection

- Strong correlations exist between **musical activity** and **mental health conditions**.
- The project revealed that music-based features can be **meaningful proxies for emotional states**.

> _This project inspired me to further explore music-aware recommendation systems that respect emotional and mental needs, not just user clicks._

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, correlation analysis, EDA, Logistic Regression, binary classification  
- **Visualization:** Pair plots, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps
