# ðŸŽ¶ Music data analysis / ML project ðŸŽ¶

<br>

## âœ… Project background
### The recommendation algorithm of YouTube is great at suggesting similar types of music based on the user's selected preferences. However, it rarely recommends other types of music that the user may not usually listen to but is interested in exploring. This can lead to feelings of regret as the user may miss out on discovering new music. It would be better if the algorithm could suggest other types of music that people with similar music tastes might enjoy listening to.

### I had an idea to suggest music not only based on people's preferred genres but also based on their specific characteristics. For instance, if a certain genre of music is popular among people with insomnia, the algorithm could recommend music that has been proven to help alleviate insomnia. I conducted a project to analyze music-related data, specifically focusing on the relationship between music and mental health. Going forward, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate the insights gained from this analysis into a recommendation system.

### After analyzing the data, I specifically examined the information related to insomnia. Subsequently, I conducted modelling and assessment to determine if individuals had insomnia based on various characteristics.
